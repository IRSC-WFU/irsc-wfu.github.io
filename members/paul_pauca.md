I am a Professor of Computer Science at Wake Forest University, Lelia and David Farr Professor of Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship, and Faculty Director of the [Center for Entrepreneurship](http://wfuentrepreneurship.info/).


I am interested in various aspects of computing and entrepreneurship, with emphasis in the application of these fields to the benefit of society. For specific information visit my research and teaching pages.


My wife Theresa and I are also actively involved in advocacy for disabilities locally and internationally. Visit the [Pitt Hopkins Research Foundation](http://pitthopkins.org/) to learn more about our work in raising awareness and research in Pitt Hopkins Syndrome.


Literacy among Hispanic children in the US and abroad is also a topic close to our hearts. My father runs an award-winning [literacy project in Amantani, Peru](http://literacylaketiticaca.blogspot.com/). Contact me if you are interested in related service learning opportunities in Peru.
