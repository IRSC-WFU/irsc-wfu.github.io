Robert is a senior mathematics and computer science double major. His research with the 
IRSC Lab involves object detection, image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and statistical 
methods for understanding mining activity. He is also currently leading the lab's 
Student Research Team.


Robert is also involved in research for his senior theses on the PaLD clustering algorithm with high performance 
computing and with computational optimizations for molecular dynamics simulations using GPUs. Robert is currently 
applying to graduate school for an MS in biostatistics with the intent to continue to his PhD. He is interested in 
multi-omics, specifically statistical genetics and genomics, and modern high performance computing methods.

In his spare time, Robert enjoys learning languages (currently speaks English, Spanish, Chinese 
and Korean) and practicing calisthenics.
