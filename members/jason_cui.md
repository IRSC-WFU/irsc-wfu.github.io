Jason is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at City University of Hong Kong. His research with the IRSC Lab focuses on developing efficient semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify changes in mining activities. 


His research includes blind spectral unmixing, spectral graph theory, and unsupervised & semi-supervised machine learning with applications on identifying land covers in remotely sensed images. He also works on medical problems, such as cell segmentation and classification.


In his free time, Jason enjoys hiking, playing Splatoon & FIFA, and watching soccer games. He is a big fan of FC Barcelona.
