My name is Shanyu Gowdu and I am a junior at NCSSM(North Carolina School of Science and Math). I am very interested in the field of data science and plan on pursuing it as a career. I have worked on creating a cryptocurrency portfolio using mean-variance optimization through the utilization of python for Credit Suisse. I have also completed the Foundations of Data Science course at NCSSM and am currently enrolled in Advanced Data Science.
