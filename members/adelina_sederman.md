Adelina is a junior Engineering Science major modified with Environmental Sciences at Dartmouth College. As a part of the Student Research Team, she has learned Python to build analytical models and intends to use object detection and image segmentation to explore the impacts of mining on wildlife distribution.
Her past research in high efficiency power electronics involved the simulation of flux lines from various coil patterns for inductors in order to minimize the size and cost of such energy tools.


After completing her undergraduate studies, Adelina plans to pursue a career in environmental engineering with interests in sustainable design, clean energy and resource management. Her hobbies include dancing, curating playlists, and up-cycling for clothing and craft-related projects.
