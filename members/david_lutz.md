David Lutz is an environmental scientist and ecologist with a background in simulation modeling, remote sensing, and ecological economics. His research focuses on documenting and analyzing environmental change through the use of novel modern technological methods. In addition, he is keenly interested in the construction of simulation and empirical models to investigate optimal adaptive management strategies that allow for the continued delivery of ecosystem services from natural landscapes in future scenarios of change. David is the Primary Investigator of a NASA Interdisciplinary Science project that utilizes the historical satellite archive and three decades of citizen science observations to observe changes in water quality in New England lakes. In addition, he is currently an active collaborator at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest and Dartmouth's Second College Grant with the U.S. Forest Service to develop Arduino-based wireless sensor networks to monitor changing environmental conditions.
