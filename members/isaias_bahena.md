Isaias is a freshman at Wake Forest University. He is planning to double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Engineering. His research with the IRSC Lab student team involves reading in image data and plotting it using various different types of graphs to find any useful information to the group. He is currently working on constructing neural networks and has learned machine learning. 
Isaias also plans on participating in the URECA program offered by Wake Forest University in the summer. His research project will be using neural networks for road detection. This project will allow for the recognition of various roads from satellite or drone images. This greatly enhances what the research group will be able to do and leads to further in depth research. 
After completing his undergraduate, Isaias plans to pursue graduate school to receive a masters degree in computer science. He then wants to go into industry as a software engineer. In his spare time Isaias likes to watch movies, tv shows, watch/play basketball, work out, play video games, or read comics.
