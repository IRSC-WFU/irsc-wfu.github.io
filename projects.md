#### Image Segmentation
Image segmentation is an extremely important area of research in computer vision. For our applications, it allows us to scan over large regions 
in order to quickly understand the composition of there areas. Our lab is applying several recent image segmentation techniques that have been 
developed in other fields and adapting them to our problems with satellite imagery.
